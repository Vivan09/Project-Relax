# ProjectRelax

ProjectRelax is a mobile application and a collection of mini-games designed for children to improve emotional wellbeing, practice self-regulation skills, and relieve stress. The project is developed by a team; the repository owner (Vivan09) contributed to UI/menu design and implemented several Unity mini-games contained in the `Ivan` folder.

## Overview & Purpose

ProjectRelax helps children relax and refocus through calming activities: breathing exercises, nature sounds, and gentle interactive games. The project is specifically intended to support children affected by the war in Ukraine — providing safe, calming, and non‑threatening digital activities to help reduce anxiety and restore emotional balance.

## My role and contribution

My working folder in the repository: `Ivan`.

I designed the main menu and implemented three Unity mini-games:

- Falling Leaves (Falling Leaves mini-game)  
  - A serene nature scene with bird songs and a soft ambient background (tree, grass, etc.). The player controls a basket and must catch falling apples while avoiding falling leaves. The game is intended to be calming and focus-promoting rather than competitive.

- Puzzles (Jigsaw Puzzles)  
  - A simple puzzle mode where the player selects an image and assembles its pieces. The mechanic is gentle and helps with concentration and fine motor skills.

- Fluid Simulation (Metaballs / Liquid Simulation)  
  - A relaxing sandbox where the player creates a "planet" from particles. Particles are rendered and smoothed using a metaballs shader to form liquid-like shapes that are attracted to the center of the screen. Players can decorate the planet with trees. There are interactions between particle types — for example, grass disappears on contact with lava; water and lava can mutually disappear on contact — enabling exploratory and creative play. The game is meditative and encourages experimentation.

All three mini-games are implemented in Unity and are part of a single Unity project where mini-games are selected according to the player's emotional state.
